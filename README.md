# NGN Plugin Template

This project template supports creation of NGN plugins. This template was not designed to be used directly. It is used to setup projects using the [NGND (NGN Dev) CLI tool](https"//github/com/ngnjs/cli).

The template contains:

1. Source Code
1. Unit Test Boilerplate
1. CI/CD Runner
1. Autopublishing (triggered on new `package.json` versions)
1. Standard License, Contributor files, Author files, support, and code of conduct.
